                Thanks to Colossus, it took just hours instead of weeks to complete the calculations needed to break German codes. In order to speed up the calculations further, Flowers and his team built more Colossus machines. The original Colossus Mark I was replaced by Colossus Mark II, which began working on 1 June 1944, just five days ahead of D Day. This new machine used 2,400 vacuum tubes – 900 more than Mark I – and was about five times faster.3 By the end of the war, there were 10 Colossus machines.

In 2007, a replica Colossus that British engineer Tony Sale and his team built took part in a global Colossus Cipher Challenge. It succeeded in breaking the Lorenz code in just 3.5 hours – but the winner cracked the code in 46 seconds, using a PC!

            An English mathematician, logician and cryptographer, Alan Turing was responsible for breaking the Nazi Enigma code during World War II. His work gave the Allies the edge they needed to win the war in Europe, and led to the creation of the computer
