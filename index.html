        <h2>Introduction</h2>
       
        <p>
            Hut 8 was a section in the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park (the British World War II codebreaking station, located in Buckinghamshire) tasked with solving German naval (Kriegsmarine) Enigma messages. The section was led initially by Alan Turing. He was succeeded in November 1942 by his deputy, Hugh Alexander. Patrick Mahon succeeded Alexander in September 1944.

Hut 8 was partnered with Hut 4, which handled the translation and intelligence analysis of the raw decrypts provided by Hut 8.

Located initially in one of the original single-story wooden huts, the name "Hut 8" was retained when Huts 3, 6 & 8 moved to a new brick building, Block D, in February 1943.

After 2005, the first Hut 8 was restored to its wartime condition, and it now houses the "HMS Petard Exhibition".

        <h2>Alan Turing</h2>

        <p>
            An English mathematician, logician and cryptographer, Alan Turing was responsible for breaking the Nazi Enigma code during World War II. His work gave the Allies the edge they needed to win the war in Europe, and led to the creation of the computer Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in southern England. He graduated at King's College, Cambridge, with a degree in mathematics. Whilst he was a fellow at Cambridge, he published a proof demonstrating that some purely mathematical yes–no questions can never be answered by computation and defined a Turing machine, and went on to prove the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable. In 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University. During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence.

        <h2>The colossus machine</h2>

        <p>
            Thanks to Colossus, it took just hours instead of weeks to complete the calculations needed to break German codes. In order to speed up the calculations further, Flowers and his team built more Colossus machines. The original Colossus Mark I was replaced by Colossus Mark II, which began working on 1 June 1944, just five days ahead of D Day. This new machine used 2,400 vacuum tubes – 900 more than Mark I – and was about five times faster.3 By the end of the war, there were 10 Colossus machines.

In 2007, a replica Colossus that British engineer Tony Sale and his team built took part in a global Colossus Cipher Challenge. It succeeded in breaking the Lorenz code in just 3.5 hours – but the winner cracked the code in 46 seconds, using a PC!
